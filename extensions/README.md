# Extensions

This directory contains extensions to the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec).  Extensions are optional additions to the core specification.  Implementation and support of these specifications are not required in order for a platform to be considered compliant.  However, if the features addressed by these specifications are supported, a platform must be in compliance with the specification that governs that feature.  Both the core spec and the extensions are going to have their independent release cycles.
